# Netflix-Data-Analysis-and-Classification-with-Neural-Networks

This project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and classification of Netflix content (Movies or TV Shows) using a neural network model built with TensorFlow/Keras.

## Features
- Handles missing data and categorical feature encoding.
- Balances classes using SMOTE.
- Implements a neural network for binary classification.
- Evaluates performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: [Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows).

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/netflix-classification.git
   cd netflix-classification
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow imbalanced-learn matplotlib
   ```
3. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place `netflix_titles.csv` in the project directory.

## Run
Execute the script:
```bash
python netflix_classification.py
```

## Results
- Achieved test accuracy .
- Includes confusion matrix and classification report for evaluation.
